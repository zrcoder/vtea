5. Submit a pull request to the main repository

When submitting a pull request, please:

- Include a clear description of the changes
- Link to any relevant issues
- Follow the existing code style
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zrcoder/vtea.git
   cd vtea
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod download
   ```

3. Run the example:
   ```
   cd example
   go run main.go
   ```

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go code style and conventions
- Use `go fmt` before committing
- Use `goimports` to organize imports
- Write descriptive comments for exported functions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Testing

Add tests for new functionality. Run the tests with:

```
go test ./...
```

## Documentation

Update documentation when adding or changing features:

- Update godoc comments for all exported types, constants, variables, and functions
- Add detailed package documentation where needed
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- Update the README.md with examples if necessary
- Document new options or functions
- If adding a new option to the `options` struct, provide a corresponding `With*` function

Documentation should follow Go's best practices:
- Use complete sentences for package, type, and function comments
- Document all exported identifiers
- Use clear, concise language
- Explain "why" not just "what" for complex operations
